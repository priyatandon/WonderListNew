# ToDOList-App
# Pre-work - *WonderList*

**Wonderlist** is an android app that allows building a todo list and basic todo items management functionality including adding new items, editing and deleting an existing item.

Submitted by: **Priya Tandon**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* [X] User can **tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item** and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Persist the todo items [into SQLite](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Persisting-Data-to-the-Device#sqlite) instead of a text file
* [ ] Improve style of the todo items in the list [using a custom adapter](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-an-ArrayAdapter-with-ListView)
* [ ] Add support for completion due dates for todo items (and display within listview item)
* [ ] Use a [DialogFragment](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-DialogFragment) instead of new Activity for editing items
* [ ] Add support for selecting the priority of each todo item (and display in listview item)
* [ ] Tweak the style improving the UI / UX, play with colors, images or backgrounds

## Project Analysis

As part of your pre-work submission, please reflect on the app and answer the following questions below:

**Question 1:** "What are your reactions to the Android app development platform so far? Compare and contrast Android's approach to layouts and user interfaces in past platforms you've used."

**Answer:**  Android Studio is simple for developing Android Apps.Its Drag & Drop feature makes the app designing easier. UI screen development and design has become very easy and quick using the layouts. 

**Question 2:** "Take a moment to reflect on the `ArrayAdapter` used in your pre-work. How would you describe an adapter in this context and what is its function in Android? Why do you think the adapter is important? Explain the purpose of the `convertView` in the `getView` method of the `ArrayAdapter`."

**Answer:** Adapter provides access to data.Arrayadapter takes in the array of objects (item String in our case) and converts it into view items. These items are displayed in the listview. ArrayAdapter creates these views by calling "toString" method and item in provided String and places the result in Textview.
	    Listview only creates view for the rows that are visible. It reuses the views as we scroll to create more rows. It calls the getView method from the adapter. If Convertview argument is non-null, views are resused and else new views are created. 
	
## Notes

At first there were few problems in fetching the data from Edit Activity to Main Activity. But there were easy to solve.
